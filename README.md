# Emomo Frontend

Emomo is a meme search engine application that allows users to find memes using semantic search queries. This frontend application provides a responsive and interactive user interface for searching, browsing, and viewing memes.

## Features

- **Semantic Search**: Find memes by describing them in natural language (e.g., "happy cat", "surprised dog").
- **Meme Grid**: Browse search results or recommended memes in a responsive grid layout.
- **Detailed View**: View high-resolution memes in a modal with metadata (tags, source, description).
- **Interactive UI**: Animated transitions and hover effects using Framer Motion.
- **Recommendations**: Displays recommended memes on the home page.
- **Copy & Download**: Easily copy image links or download memes directly.
